            <h2>Introduction & Background</h2>
            <p><em>This is a basic starter page for my ITSE1301 class. I expect it will become more interesting to look
                    at as time
                    goes on...</em></p>
            <p>Allo there. My name's Lucas, and I have several hobbies & interests. I enjoy tinkering with electronics,
                especially older bits of tech. I love this stuff enough that I tend to integrate old tech into my
                lifestyle wherever possible, while still being enjoyable. Like using an iPod instead of streaming music,
                or using older PC peripherals. I’m a fan of older pop culture; old TV shows, old movies, old music. It’s
                not exclusively the only media I consume, but it’s definitely more older stuff than new. I like to drive
                my car. It’s very liberating, being able to drive anywhere. Especially at night. I love to drive at
                night, or even the early morning, when there is almost no one else on the roads. I enjoy visiting nature
                via local parks and trails. I always think I’m going to sit one day and do pencil drawings of the area.
                Still haven’t gotten around to it.</p>
            <h2>Avatar to Be</h2>
            <p>The character/avatar I've decided to use for this class is one that I've already conceived before, that
                of an old seafaring captain. "Captain Eldeezee" is his name, and is in fact just my initials sounded out
                into a word. "L-D-Z" becomes "El-dee-zee". The visual look of him is just the Simpsons sea captain
                character.</p>
